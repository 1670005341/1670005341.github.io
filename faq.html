					  		  <h3>I have additional people in my team, Can they be counted as subsitute or a coach?</h3>
					  		  <p>Yes, however, you may not switch members in the middle of the match. That includes half-time, as well. You may switch members afterwards.</p>
							  <p>Coaches are allowed to join and supervise the team, however they are not allowed to play the match itself. They may communicate only via discord. </p>
					  		  <h3>I placed my user config file in a usb. Is that allowed?</h3>
					  		  <p>For security reasons, USB's are not allowed to be brought into the arena, even if its empty. You will need to fill the crosshair and sensitivity in the online form. You can find your config file in <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/guides/*">this guide here.</a></p>
					  		  <h3>How am i going to communicate with other teammates?</h3>
								<p>TeamSpeak 3 or in game. This will be decided later on.</p>
							<h3>Do i need to bring an ID Card on the event?</h3>
								<p>Yes, please bring a student card if you're under 17, or KTP if you're above 18.</p>
							<h3>How does the veto system work?</h3>
								<p>Team captain must duel to determine who votes first, then vote maps using the in-game controls.</p>
